aper we distinguish between international collabora tic collaboration and within university collaboration mine how they are related to the quality of individual the annual output of individual scientists;; We col for a panel of 65 biomedical scientists over a 14 year void understating within university collaboration we ly codedcollaborationvariablesbasedonco authorship by visual inspection of every publication of these 65 level analyses we controlled for scientists latent abil ding a full set of scientist dummies and accounted for ndence in observations because each scientist con re than one observation to the sample by employing ized estimating equations GEE method;; We found that university collaboration and international collabora itively related to an article s quality as proxied by the or of the journal in which it was published or number it received in a 2 year window after publication;;When research output ismeasured by quan university collaboration is significantly related to a uture research output;; Therefore national collaboration expands the scope of combina h by bringing together diverse ideas and inputs from tners within university collaboration reduces the cost creases the intensity of combinatorial search through e to face interaction with co located colleagues;; At article level within university collaboration is ively related to an article s quality than is domestic or al collaboration;; At scientist year level international collaboration tively related to a scientist s future researchoutput than or within university collaboration;; At scientist year level within university collab ore positively related to a scientist s future research is domestic or international collaboration;; Second ere working at this university when this study was and we had access to personnel information of these scientists such as age gender title department affili otion administrative position etc;; For e found a paper co authored by one of the 65 scien s university address did not appear on that paper;; Then using the University Calendar which was very year we compiled a list of biomedical scientists rsity for the 14 year period;; Next we used the following four criteria to select biomedi cal scientists into the sample a full time faculty member of the university s biomedical schools b appointment with the uni versity was either confirmed or on confirmation path similar to tenured or tenure track at North American universities and no joint appointment with any other institutions c took up continu ous employment for 10 years or longer during the period from1990 to 2003 excluding partial years of participation d published 10 or more papers indexed in the ISI Web of Science database during this period;; Criteria a and b were necessary because if a scientist took a part time or joint appointment with the university her scores of collaboratio institutions to track a sc ber of years least a thres One may tive and ma these restri tion variab consistency longitudina tative samp a selective s ied enormo papers to ju Seventy However th mally large co authors such giant structure fo tion this to enough dat common su identificatio not be done The resu 2244 public reviews an scientist ye all the scien period we observation As point like the ISI W the integrit to the very university these 2244 formost of t We carefull any obvious 1 Among al authors on a p 2 Non pape 109 letters 22 3 Among the hasmistakes fo becomes a par misclassified a recorded as a c 3;;
