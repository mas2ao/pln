 31 1996 381 399 The optimal organization of research evidence from eight case studies of pharmaceutical firms Francis Tapon Charles Bram Cadsby Department of Economics University of Guelph Guelph Ontario MG 2W1 Canada Received 23 February 1994 Abstract In this paper we examine the results of interviews of scientists and executives in eight pharmaceutical companies on the issue of how best to organize the R D function;; The links to outside organizations that were studied in that paper were long term R D joint ventures with university laboratories;; The article foresaw the growth of these unconventional corporate university arrangements;; Rational drug design requires a very strong foundation of basic research which most often thrives in university or certain independent laboratories as well as in national research institutes;; Pharmaceutical firms which linked up with university laboratories would likely be more successful than those which did not;; Joint ventures with university laboratories appeared to be a promising strategy;; Specialists in biological research were to be found mostly in universities hence a link up with a university laboratory enabled firms to tap this new kind of expertise;; Tapon s 1989 article used transaction costs analysis to hypothesize that new hybrid R D organizations linking privately owned firms and publicly owned institutions like university laboratories would become a solution of choice to the R D governance problem in the pharmaceutical industry;; We also interviewed the Director of University and Scientific Affairs of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of Canada;; In order to obtain a variety of perspectives we sought to have one firm which conducts most of its R D in house MNCl and another which is engaged in significant and numerous long term R D contracts with university laboratories MNC2 ;; The three remaining MNCs MNC3 MNC4 MNCS are also involved in R D outsourcing contracts with university and independent laboratories but at the time of the interviews had signed fewer contracts with considerably less money involved than those signed by MNC2;; Two of the three Canadian firms Canadian Firm 1 Canadian Firm 2 are much smaller but spend significant amounts on R D and they too are outsourcing some R D activities with university laboratories;; The Canadian generic producer is beginning to set up its own R D operations and does not yet outsource research activities with independent and or university laboratories;;7 The significant exception in our sample MNC2 broke new ground by linking with a university laboratory;; The second is to link through equity stakes and or long term joint ventures with biotechnology startups or university and government laboratories;; Basic research in a pharmaceutical firm is more focused than in a university laboratory because in an industrial setting a compound must eventually emerge from that research deadlines must be met and sometimes management dictates to scientists the type of research they must carry out;; We ve created a university atmosphere within the company and are clearly not getting the compounds that we need for the future so we have to change the approach;; University professors on sabbatical are encouraged to arrange long term research visits;; We found in our sample examples of firms signing long term R D contracts with university laboratories or other fiis which are ahead of the firm s own scientists in an area of interest to the firm and using the competition with these laboratories as a way of enhancing the work of its own scientists;; Researchers at the University of Sussex 1972 4 9 have studied 29 successful and 29 unsuccessful innovations and found that five factors were sufficient to distinguish successful from unsuccessful innovations;; Similarly in a comparison of the British and German machine tool industries Parkinson 1984 finds that the greater success of German machine tool manufacturers is accounted for by greater direct involvement with customers in the design and development of new machine tools machine tools designed to individual customer specifications superior technical quality in product design better contacts with university and research institutions and well organized and informed customers;; 13Tapon 1989 has argued that R D transactions with university partners do not suffer as much as with independent laboratories from the effects of opportunism;; I would say the big part of collaborative research with the university is when we are targeting a therapeutic area that we are interested in and we have some expertise in but we want to supplement our expertise;; Inside talk at MNC2 as in many companies was sort of an expression that described these long term R D agreements with university laboratories ;; In this circumstance the independent university laboratory helps the firm establish its own research in a new area by teaching it new techniques;; The evidence for this statement is provided by the acknowledgement on the part of our interviewees that their firms are simultaneously building up their research capability in house in the areas covered by the long term university agreements;; The third motive for firms to link up with university laboratories is to satisfy governments in host countries;; The quickest and most effective way of launching a research program when none exists is to link up with a reputable university laboratory;; A scientist at MNC4 explains These long term R D joint ventures with university laboratories are mechanisms or ways in which the company can increase its R D efforts and at the same time create a presence in jurisdictions where it would not normally have a presence in research and development because of course research is primarily conducted at the company based in the United States Japan and the United Kingdom;; Conclusions We started this research with the belief that progressive pharmaceutical companies were opening up their R D process by contracting out basic research and sometimes applied research to external laboratories university or independent ;;
