 The objective of this paper is to define the factors that influence thesence regions;; Therefore the objective of this paper is to define the factors influencing these public TCs so that appropriate action can then be taken to reduce them;; Another important factor in terms of the characteristics of AESs is the degree to which the scheme objectives are pursued by monitoring;; Apart from questions on public TCs the questionnaire also contained questions regarding the organization to which the respondent belongs the natural environment the effectiveness efficiency and objectives of AESs participation of actors in AES design and implementation and institutional alternatives for AESs;;044 Importance of the objective to reduce negative impacts of agriculture 0;; Less time is spent on AES design if the respondent believes that reducing the negative impact of agriculture is an important objective of the AES thanwhen the AES is believed to focus on stimulating positive externalities or adapting farming systems to the changing price and policy environment;; It also identifies another significant influencing variable in this category namely the objective of the scheme;; The model predicted lower AES design costs if the main objective of AESs is only to reduce the negative environmental impacts of agriculture suggesting that it is much more difficult to design schemes to stimulate the positive externalities of farming;;847 15 44 19 5 1 Objective not important 0 Third most important objective 1 Second most important objective 2 Most important objective 3 Importance of objective to reduce negative impacts of agriculture 1;;
