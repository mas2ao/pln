 These units are broken up along functional areas and objectives;;An objective is a goal of a firm such as produce an automobile or sell real estate;; Organizing along objective lines results in a form of vertical integration although units are not necessarily linked in a linear way;; The functional areas are specific tasks common to multiple objectives such as website hosting application support and data center management;; A unit then is a specific function for a specific objective;; A firm is a collection of different units usually arranged either by objective or by function;; We can think of an automotive firm as being arranged by objective while anASP firm is arranged by function;; For the purposes of this paper motivating the employee is the same as motivating the unit;; Assume that each unit receives its own shock denoted by ObjectiveFunction;; We define a focal firm as a firm that manages multiple different functional areas with the same objective;; We define the partner as a firm that manages multiple identical functional areas with different objectives;; The idea that partner firms focusing on specific functions rather than overall objectives can offer better incentives to employees is supported in the literature;; If Var IT1 IT2 Var IT1 o1 then it is not necessarily true that the partner can find an equivalent scheme based on the output of the same function in other objectives that results in the same effort level eIT on behalf of the IT manager;; An obvious candidate condition is that the partner firm performs substantially similar activities across a number of similar objectives;; Another possibility is that there are functional and objective shocks;; Functional shocks would be those shocks that occur to all units in a specific function while objective shocks would occur to all units with a similar objective;; Thus the financial reporting function would be impacted across multiple objectives;; An example of an objective shock would be cyclical variation in the objective area like Christmas;; This characterization shows that the observable output of a unit manager is a function of his effort plus the shock to the objective plus the shock to the function;; Thus when shocks to IT infrastructure are larger than shocks to business objectives it makes more sense to form partnerships with the partners in order to control the variance;; Why is relational business becoming more prevalent Taken together the idea that firms should use relational business management for IT infrastructure when the infras tructure shocks are greater than the objective shocks and the idea that as a unit s output becomes less variable both in house and relational management are equally acceptable provide a basis for understanding the rise of the relational mode for the management of IT units;; Hoffman Computers Operations Research 34 2007 3575 3591 IT infrastructure functions are likely to be much greater than the magnitude of the shocks within business objectives resulting in greater value in delegatingmanagement of those units to firms that can better measure the functional shocks;; This means that the provider firm purposefully chooses to ignore some of the output information and by doing so actually encourages greater effort;;
