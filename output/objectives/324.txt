 The purpose of this review is to outline a conceptual framework of organizational diversification to assess research methods used and to review the state of empirical research on hospital organizational diversification;; For example while Newhouse 37 long ago demonstrated that the behavior of non profit hospitals is better described by output maximization than the profit maximizing objective function of the proprietary hospital most empirical research continues to use A nn u;; P1 KKK dat P2 ARK ary QC ARK February 19 1998 12 10 Annual Reviews AR054 18 HOSPITAL ORGANIZATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION 419 one objective function for all forms of ownership attempting to capture all the variation due to organization in a dummy variable;; A hospital owned or affiliated independent practice association IPA may serve the same purposes although physicians may belong to multiple IPAs;; MODELING CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF ORGANIZATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION The types of models used in empirical analyses of organizational change and diversification can be grouped using a combination of criteria the implied direction of causality the type of dependent variable and the objective function being modeled;; Determinants of change are derived from the characteristics of hospitals and their markets wherein change occurs or the pre change objectives of managers;; There is a large body of economic literature on health care cost function estimation Grannemann et al 24 describe extension of cost functions for multiple outputs Keeler Ying 25 discuss nonlinearities and the objective function Gertler Waldman 22 focus on measures of omitted quality and Newhouse 38 reviews a wide range of issues;; P1 KKK dat P2 ARK ary QC ARK February 19 1998 12 10 Annual Reviews AR054 18 HOSPITAL ORGANIZATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION 427 Table 2 Variables used in models of hospital costs and financial performance Dependent variables Methodological concerns Expenses total per patient day per discharge Self selection bias Depreciation and interest expenses Latent effects Financial ratios stock value operating margin Occupancy rate Independent variables Output quantities Omitted variables heterogeneity Inpatient days discharges Outpatient visits revenue share High low technology service volumes Occupancy rate Endogeneity Input prices Omitted variables Wage rate Input quantitiesa Objective function Beds Physicians per bed Ownership and control For profit non profit government religious Teaching Integration and diversification Cause effect relationship feedback In system Physician organization diversification Market structure Omitted variables Casemix index HMO penetration Payer mix Per capita income Urban rural Hospital concentration HHI Fixed effects or stratification variable State regulation aIncluding beds makes for a short run cost function other input quantities violate cost function assumptions;; While some studies interviewed hospi tal managers to elicit the objectives of horizontal integration efforts most ana lyzed the characteristics of hospitals using samples drawn from cross sectional secondary data from this the authors infer the likelihood of future horizon tal integration among similar facilities;; This was the only study that sur veyed managers to elicit their objectives for merging;; Stated objectives for merger included reduction in competition to achieve service complementarities from consolidation and expansion of local or regional networks to improve marketability to managed care plans in broader markets;; While many potential objectives for merger have been identified through interviews with hospital managers researchers have rarely studied the ability of mergers to achieve the envisioned post merger operational changes;; Bogue et al 7 compared stated objectives for merger to the percentage of merged facilities where one hospital dropped or both retained acute care functions;; Mergers with the objective of achieving operating economies usually resulted in only one facility dropping acute care functions whereas those seeking to expand access to care or system size usually resulted in both retaining acute care functions;;
