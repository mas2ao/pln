 The MIP model uses the ex pected net incomes of the parties involved as arguments in the objective function and not as in Dorward the differences between expected incomes and deviations between these expected incomes and certain target incomes;; Agricuactivities of the association have three purposes 1 the reduction of rejection rates by monitoring the quality of produce at the col lection point 2 the improvement of product coordination andand other transaction costs;; This can be compared with co operatives that have contractual purposes to deal with perceived market failures Cook 1995 and with bargaining co operatives described by Knoeber 1983 as collective organisations to contract with processors for the sale of their members crops;; The objective function is designed to allow for analysing the changing distributions of bargaining power between the farmers and the firm;; In the objective function this coefficient is multiplied by the expected incomes;; In w k 0 the objective function represents the expected income of the farmers whereas if w k 1 this function represents the ex pected income of the processor;; For values of w k between 0 and 1 the objective function is a weighted average of both these incomes;; We assumed that w GC 1 which means that the processor s ex pected income determines the objective function but this income is negatively influenced by the probability of farmers behaving opportunistically;; The model uses the expected net incomes of the parties as arguments in the objective function and each party s expected income is corrected by the probability of the other party s behaving opportunistically;; In this scenario the farmers expected income entirely determines the objective function in the case of a group contract and this income is also determined by the probability of the pro cessor behaving opportunistically;; In this scenario the processor s and farmers expected incomes are weighted equally in the objective function while both incomes are determined by the probability of both parties behaving opportunistically;; In the first price plays an important role as an autonomous adaptation while in the second the adjustment also comes from mutual agreement between two parties working together for a cer tain purpose producing and selling pepper ;; Symbol Explanation Units A Objective variable to be maximised US Bkjs Expected income of buyer processor US Skjs Expected income of seller farmer US Xkjs Volume of traded fresh pepper kg Fkjs Price of fresh pepper US kg Zb Sum of buyer s income deviations from target income US kjs Zs kjs Sum of seller s income deviations from target income US Ykjs Binary marketing choice variable dition s ;; comes of d se e e ce ment k o lo refkjs frp lturaThe model specifications are as follows Objective function US Max A X kjs wkBkjsprbkjs X kjs 1 wk Skjsprskjs 1 Net income calculations US B X 1 ref indy frp Table 8 Coefficients used in the model with units;; Probabilities sum to one for each market condition s ability of farmers behaving opportunistically is highe processor chooses individual contracts and lower wheIn the objective function 1 the sum of the net incomes of both processor and farmers A is maximised;;
