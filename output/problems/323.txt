 Whereas TC economists have focused on explaining how the risk of hold up when undertaking important investments specific to a frequent transaction in an uncertain environment influences the 632 Inf Syst Front 2010 12 631 645 mode of organizing a transaction positive agency theorists study the effect that measurement problems derived from moral hazard and adverse selection cause Mahoney 1992 ;; Efficiency tends to be associated with the maximization of the use of rules routines and other integration mechanisms that economize on communication and knowledge transfer whereas problem solving and decision making by teams is reserved for unusual complex and important tasks Grant 1996 ;; In the presence of hold up problems in house implementation enjoys a progressive governance cost advantage over outsourcing since it reduces the motivation to expropriate the value of those investments through monitoring and fiat makes it easier to accomplish adaptive sequential Table 1 Empirical evidence on the determinants of IT outsourcing decisions from a TC and RB approach Variables Relationship with IT outsourcing Significant Partially significant No significant From a TC approach Perceived opportunistic behavior of providers Nam et al;;2 Uncertainty The information asymmetry between the organization on behalf of which the implementation is performed the principal and the organization which performs that function the agent is caused basically by measurement problems i;; When measurement problems exist firms tend to insource the IT implementation;; By repetitively interacting with IT providers firms gain information about one another s behavior and in stable environments that learning attenuates moral hazard problems through the evolution of norms of reciprocity and coopera tion and the routinization of behaviors Langlois 1992 ;; Hypothesis 3 proposes a negative influence of measure ment problems on the IT outsourcing choice;; This means that firms appear not to have problems in determining whether the implementation has been carried out according to the agreed terms or whether the performance of the application meets expectations;; First consistent with Jensen and Meckling 1976 mea surement problems may equally damage the performance of both internal and external sourcing modes which makes the choice irrelevant;; Second client firms may not have difficulties in verifying whether compliance with established agreements has occurred during or after the implementation process either because the IT implementation does not involve a high degree of organizational and technological complexity or because the firm has learned to reduce these measure ment problems throughout past experiences;; Firm s experience in external agreements is not sufficient to decrease the measurement problems associated with out sourcing only successful prior experiences reduce the risk of opportunistic behaviors;; It may also explain that the firm s previous experience in outsourcing this activity does not play a significant role either directly or by diminishing the uncertainty caused by measurement problems;; Although it overcomes some drawbacks of previous works by identifying who performs the IT implementation and assessing the relative contribution of the parties involved it does not allow us to determine the allocation of decision rights;;
