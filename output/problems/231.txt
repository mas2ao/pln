 A solution is to link with a more diverse set of external actors;; We used this approach whichwe adopted from the European Community Innovation Survey because data collection problems become exceedingly large when firms are asked about characteristics of more than one IOR;; All bivariate correlations are well below the threshold levels at which multicollinearity becomes a problem Verbeek 2004 ;; We found high correlations between the different variables that measure perceived levels of uncertainty at the firm level but these correlations are not problematic from a multicollinearity perspective;;68 which is not problematic from a multicollinearity perspective;; If this one class solution does not fit the data well the analysis incrementally adds latent classes to the model until the model fit is adequate;; Dependent variable configurations of knowledge transfer IORs Our latent class cluster analysis reveals that a four clusters solution has the lowest BIC see Table 4 and hence fit the data best;; Number of clusters Model fit BIC 1 Cluster solution 5293 8559 2 Cluster solution 4942 2767 3 Cluster solution 4872 9409 4 Cluster solution 4872 5662 5 Cluster solution 4900 4147 8 This solution has a classification error of 8;; Even though these criteria provide information regarding the fit of the cluster solution the goal of a latent class cluster approach is not to minimize classification error or maximize explained variance;; For example a single cluster solution would per definition yield a classification error of 0 ;; Problems of explanation in economic sociology;; The search transfer problem the role of weak ties in sharing knowledge across organization subunits;;
