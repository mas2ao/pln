 An agricultural or horticultural chain of production faces two hold up problems;; The hold up problem faced by farmers has been a critical driving force behind the emergence of the MC as an organisational form in the past;; The corporation or investor owned firm in which shareholders are the owners of the en terprise resolves this hold up problem;; 4This problem becomes worse in a MC because the residual claims in a MC are typically based on patronage and volume of member business rather than amount of stock or level of invest ment;; Williamson 1985 argues that this causes problems;; It causes problems when the parties involved in the exchange make specific irreversible or sunk in vestments i;; This is the inefficient hold up problem Klein et al;; A suitable choice of governance structure mitigates or even eliminates the hold up problem;;2 address how the various organ isational and financial governance structures deal with the hold up problem;; Barzel 1982 advocates a fo cus on measurement problems instead of asset specificity which receives empirical support in Anderson and Schmittlein 1984 ;; Empirical evidence has to tell whether an asset specificity specifi cation or a measurement problems specification as exogenous vari ables is most suitable in explaining governance structure changes in agricultural and horticultural markets;; However exchange in markets becomes problematic when the level of asset specificity is increasing due to the increasing prominence of the hold up problem;; This is especially problematic when the hold up problem looms i;;3 in order to state the main hypothesis in terms of the second hold up problem;; It will be argued that this hypothesis con tinues to hold when the first hold up problem is also taken into account;; This problem seems to be increasing when markets become more complex;; This limited appropriability problem requires that the internal rate of return on the assets of MCs must be higher than that of CFs if internally financed investment is to be chosen when the median membership duration is shorter than the project s recoupment period Bonin et al;; The problem is get ting worse due to adverse changes in the demographic composition of the member population which will be reflected in the outcome of the democratic decision making process Hart and Moore 1994 ;; A CF does not face this problem because providers of equity decide themselves how their money will be spent in order to add value to the harvest;; How ever this problem is circumvented here because the or ganisational and financial choice of governance point in the same direction when the level of asset specificity increases;; There is also the hold up problem regarding the farm investments;; However the results of our analysis do not change when this hold up problem is included in the analysis;; Our claims re garding the level of asset specificity of the investments at the processor are formulated relative to the hold up problem regarding farm investments;; Grossman and Hart 1986 have analysed a situation with two hold up problems;; The main result of the Grossman and Hart analysis 1986 is that firm 1 control will be desir able when firm 1 s ex ante investment is much more important than firm 2 s so that firm 2 s underinvest ment under firm 1 control is relatively unimportant and when overinvestment by firm 1 under firm 1 con trol is a less severe problem than underinvestment by firm 1 and non integration is desirable if the two in vestments are both important in some sense so that it is preferable to have both of them at a medium level than to have one very high and the other very low as under integration ;; The change at American Crystal Sugar does not undermine our theory because it provides an example of increasing importance of the first hold up problem without making any references to the final product market;; If the first hold up problem becomes more important and the second does not then our theory predicts that switches from a CF to an MC are to be expected;; l 6 A referee indicated that the perishability of crops is nowadays not as much a problem anymore due to technological developments;; This observation strengthens our claim because it suggests that the first hold up problem has diminished in importance compared to the second hold up;; A governance structure has to address two hold up problems in an agricultural or horticultural chain of production;; The countervailing power feature of a MC resolves the first problem;; The second problem is not material when the investments of a MC are not specific which is the case in markets characterised by homogeneous products;; However a MC is not able to resolve both problems in differentiated product markets which require investments with a high level of asset speci ficity at the processing stage of production e;; The attractiveness of a MC decreases with re spect to choosing efficient investment levels because democratic decision making becomes more problem atic and members will also take considerations re garding return on farm investments into account when this decision is made;; This is also problematic from a financial governance perspective because the terms at which financial funds are made available by outsiders are worse than those faced by a CF when the level of asset specificity is high;; The resolution of the second problem re quires a switch from a MC to a CF;; Most solutions which are nowadays considered within the MC structure con sist of some differentiation in the financial terms being offered to members;; However this does not solve the second hold up problem;; A MC has to solve two hold up problems which is asking too much;; The introduction of other organisational arrangements association participation company may resolve the lack of countervailing power when the MC is abandoned;;
