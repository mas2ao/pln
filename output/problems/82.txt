 In particular with the growing importance of supply chain manage ment within the OM discipline considerable oppor tunities exist for better understanding and application of TCT to OM problems and methodologies;; So we will retain in our study a focus on the manufacturing sector within the broader rubric of OM discipline and investigate the application of TCT to operations and supply chain management problems;; TCT views bounded rationality as a problem under conditions of uncertainty;; These conditions make it difficult to fully specify the conditions surrounding an exchange thereby occasioning an economic problem;; The latter behavioral uncertainty includes performance evaluation and information asymmetry problems;; High levels of uncertainty could create information processing problems in firms that might make markets more preferable Schelanski and Klein 1995 ;; At worst TCT offers an important theoretical lens for a number of problems relevant to OM;; A re view of these studies can provide insight into the var ious problems and results specifically pertaining to an industry set that is pivotal to OM and supply chain management researchers;; Four dimen sions were operationalized a effort required in developing the relationship effort b monitoring the performance of Supplier S monitor c ad dressing problems that might arise in the relationship with Supplier S problem and d the likelihood of Supplier S taking advantage of the relationship advantage ;; Please indicate the extent to which you agree with the following statements by circling the appropriate number In developing an association with Supplier S with respect to Component C It was understood in advance what this relationship would involve Mang01 Significant effort was required to gather the information necessary to outline the working relationship with Supplier S Mang02 It was straightforward and easy to work out the main issues and necessary details of the relationship with Supplier S Mang03 There were many unspecified terms which had to be worked out as the relationship with Supplier S developed Mang04 It required significant effort to determine individual roles to be performed by our firm and Supplier S Mang05 In monitoring the performance of Supplier S It is easy to tell if we were receiving fair treatment from Supplier S Mang06 It takes significant effort to detect whether or not Supplier S conforms to specifications and quality standards Mang07 We are in a good position to evaluate how fairly our Supplier S deals with us Mang08 Accurately evaluating Supplier S requires a lot of effort Mang09 There is not much concern about Supplier S taking advantage of this Relationship Mang10 It is costly in time and effort to clearly monitor the performance of Supplier S Mang11 In addressing problems that might arise in the relationship with Supplier S The approach to solving problems in our relationship with Supplier S is clear cut Mang12 There are standard solutions or approaches to problems that might occur with Supplier S Mang13 Problem solving is often challenging due to the nature of Component C Mang14 Although solutions to problems can be achieved they would often need to be highly customized Mang15 Concerning the likelihood of Supplier S taking advantage of its relationship with our firm There are no incentives for Supplier S to pursue their interests at the expense of our interests Mang16 It is easy for Supplier S to alter the facts in order to get what they wanted Mang17 There is a strong temptation for Supplier S to withhold or distort information for their benefit Mang18 It is difficult for Supplier S to promise to do things and get away without actually doing them later Mang19 There exists from Supplier S s perspective a significant motivation to take advantage of unspecified or unenforceable contract terms Mang20 To assess non response bias difference tests were con ducted on sales volume product type and component type between early and late respondents;; All 20 items shown in Table 2 and corresponding to the four latent variables of effort monitor problem and advantage were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis Lichtenstein et al;;8 Table 4 Confirmatory factor analysis results Item Effort Monitor Problem Advantage Mang02 0;;

Overall each of the four puri fied scales of effort monitor problem and advantage Fig;; Malhotra Journal of Operations Management 21 2003 457 473 required to build and maintain the relationship effort required to monitor the performance of the supplier how problems arising in the relationship are resolved and whether suppliers engage in an opportunistic be havior;; However it does not include the measurement of transaction costs associated with governance problems safeguarding adaptation and performance evaluation or opportunity costs failure to invest in productive resources maladaptation and failure to identify alternate partners Rindfleisch and Heide 1997 ;; The transaction cost measure presented in this study evaluates different aspects of relationship between inter firm entities including problem solving approaches performance monitoring and propensity for opportunistic behavior;;
