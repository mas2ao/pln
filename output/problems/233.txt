 In both cases however difficult contracting and hold up problems may ensue;; Important differences also exist such as technical uncertainty that is higher the need for creative solutions that is stronger and technology leakage that is more critical in the the supply of R D than in the supply of mature goods and services;; As a consequence R D specific transaction problems will occur that need special considerations and contractual solutions but these problems are not so special that they cannot be treated within the expandable framework of transaction cost economics here also including recent versions of property rights theory;; But then another problem is created;; But this solution too is not without problems due to the impossibility of selective interventions Williamson 1985 ;; Since both outcome uncertainty that increases financial risk and monitoring problems that increase the cost of measuring behavior characterize most R D projects hybrid contracts will often be more pertinent than the purely behavior based or outcome based contracts;; Combining the client s rights to control the supplier s R D process with the supplier s property rights to the final R D outputs is one such hybrid solution to be more closely examined in this paper;; Contractual hazards are also raised in novel projects where the supplier has insufficient information about the time or resources needed to solve the client s problem;; Technically novel projects need creative problem solving but they may also cause unwanted delays and cost overruns outcome uncertainty ;; In particular hierarchical control that is helpful in preventing deviation from known courses toward prespecified outcomes is not equally helpful in promoting the exploration of unknown courses toward innovative solutions;; The problem here is that after the project has ended and outputs are delivered the supplier can still earn extra income by selling modified copies of non specific and highly valued R D outputs to the client s competitors without compensating the client for his future income loss;; In other words by bestowing stronger property rights upon external research institutes the same institutes are more likely to develop accumulate and dissipate common technology in their own self interest and thereby contribute to solving the externality problem that would otherwise have led private production firms to underinvest in R D;; While incompletely specified projects are likely to increase the possibility of deficient solutions working on new and previously unresolved problems is likely to increase the possibility of cost overruns and unwanted delays;; Two of the items belonged to the following question Was A The main technical problems and B The main technical solutions new or well known to the engineers researchers who worked on the project Each of these items were answered with a 4 point scale 1 well 14 S;; The second control variable incompleteness was measured with four items reflecting the degree of incomplete specification of technical solutions and results;; 30 1996 63 82 were part of the following question Often projects have to be started before technical solutions and output requirements are completely clarified;; As far as this project is concerned how much would you say was clarified beforehand concerning A Technical solutions and B Technical output requirements;; Although a larger number of competing buyers makes technology leakages a more likely outcome worsens the appropriability problem and therefore vertical integration a more likely protection mechanism valuable information and technology might under the contract mode also flow the other way benefitting the client and reducing his net loss;; An even stronger demand for such a solution may arise among end users who are likely to benefit most from a more open and competitive upstream R D market;; Coase Ronald 1960 The problem of social cost The Journal of Law and Economics 3 14t;;
