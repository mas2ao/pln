 Introduction Technology development is an inve technology developers must invent interrelated problems;; Walden Decision Support Systems 48 2009 23 32problem is that contracts are poorlywritten;; Our concern iswith explicit rights and the problem that developers donot know if the explicit rights are owned or who owns them;; They can cause a lot of problems and may be pretty slippery about it;; The important thing is that these issues are resolved upfront in the charter of the organization so further negotiation among members is not necessary or at least is greatly simplified ;; If there aremany different ways of solving a problem then any one invention is less specific;; Some are created to address more complex problems than others;; Effective problem solving in IT involves breaking down the problem into smaller sub problems that are easier to comprehend and can be solved independently;; Later the individual solutions can be integrated together as a solution to the complex problem;; It is a typical knowledge management problem;; In fact engineers from different industries may not even be solving the same problem and hence it may never occur to them that their solution is logically equivalent to a problem faced by another industry;;3 Culture and vocabulary are different across countries in fact the problem is worse across countries because people are using different languages and different legal systems;; Themore people with unique knowledge that are participating in the technology development process the more likely that patent discovery can be resolved without formal search;; In practice collaborative networks often require members to fairly share their intellectual property so actually forming the body solves many coordination issues;; While having more members can have a negative effect in coordinating with outsiders if the IP network is poorly governed having more members means there is less external coordination and many of the coordination problems are solved as byproducts of the upfront cost of forming the group;; Before proceeding todiscuss directions for future research wewould like to put into perspective the size of the IP problem;; There are also groups dedicated to a single issue such as the DVD forum or Bluetooth SIG who are created to solve a specific technology problem and who will vanish when the technology is gone;; By viewing technology as a bundle of inventions rather than an artifact or one of the other variety of representations we currently have we argue that scholars and managers alike can find solutions to problems that are difficult to solve using a different perspective;; The third lesson of thiswork is tomodify and extend traditional transaction cost theory which is based on transactions involving a single physical asset to take into account the problem of bundles of inventions;;
