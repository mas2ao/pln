 W billion device maintenance market generates extreme inefficiencies in care efficiency problems from engineering operational research and business management perspectives Boyer Pronovost 2010 Friedman Mitchell 1991 Grossmann Goolsby Olsen deliver quality health services not only is it important to guarantee it is essential to agement Lenel rly maint agement s ipment is to replace it ;; Thus health care managers face an important set of questions which modality should be used to perform the medical device maintenance tasks In other words do I outsource or internalize themaintenance tasks formedical devices Despite the demonstrated applicability of interdisciplinary approaches to other healthcare systems problems the decision Corresponding author;;eengineering fields as possessing great potential and recent inter disciplinary studies have suggested interesting solutions to health after its expectancy life can be prolonged or cut short i;; Without the intention of listing all management and operations research can help in a set of very common problems pre sented in the healthcare environment including decision making capacity staffing scheduling and resource allocation;; In particular fields such as industrial engineering systems engineering management and operations research with vast experience in system design analysis and implementation of solutions across a variety of industries have the potential to increase the effectiveness safety efficiency and value in a varietyMaintenance Multivariate statistics ically support our core theoretical argument that governance financial performance is influenced by assets specificity;; The problem is not exclusive to the healthcare industry according to a survey performed by Deloitte Consulting 44 of respondents2 indicated that they saw no cost savings in their outsourced activities while only 34 of respondents were satisfied with the supplier s service quality Landis Mishra Porrello 2005 ;; This problem is compounded by the fact that maintenance outsourcing studies appear contradictory and incomplete Assaf Hassanain Al Hammad Al Nehmi 2011 Benaroch Webster Kazaz 2012 Berradea Cristiano Scarf 2012 Garg Deshmukh 2006 Miguel Rios 2012 Shafiee Chukova 2013 Simoes Gomes Yasin 2011 ;; They identified a cluster of papers that apply mathematical models to maintenance outsourcing problems noting that while these models were proposed for specific industries none was applied specifically to the maintenance outsourcing of medical devices e;; In a second cluster of papers identified as empirical longitudinal studies of maintenance outsourcing problems they found only five papers related to the per formance measurement of medical device maintenance outsourcing Cruz Aguilera Huertas D as Mora 2010 Cruz Denis 2006 Cruz Perilla et al;; The goal of this study is to bring operational and management research principles to the problem of medical device maintenance outsourcing;; cost inclusive 4 cost exclusive5 measures should compare the performance of internal versus external governance structures Geyskens Steenkamp and Kumar 2006 which becomes problematic since performance of the selected governance structure is observed while the perfor mance of those governance structures not chosen are not observed Masten 1993 Masten Meehan Snyde 1991 ;; At the same time equipment spare parts and maintenance materi als are essential because without them medical devices cannot be maintained or repaired even if problems are easily fixable Paton Nyamu 1996 Temple Bird et al;; These technologies increase the performance of the service provider value chain Dehning Richardson Zmud 2007 and create new competitive advantages for maintenance providers by anticipating equipment failures and diagnosing failures when they occur isolating the problem and identifying spare parts needed for the repair before a maintenance technician is even dispatched Blumberg 2002 108 2004 471 472 ;; In other words it was a case of the solution being worse than the problem;; However empirical results have been mixed and contradictory creating an unresolved polemic debate;; Our data showed neither collinearity nor autocorrelation problems see results section 15 COSR variable measures repeated maintenance transactions amongst the service providers therefore autocorrelation might exist;;50 or greater on a component with high condition index there is a multicollinearity problem with respect to those variables Sheskin 2007 1465 ;; Our solutions to the difficulties of measuring financial performance of maintenance transactions and the considerablySince the computed d values in all models is greater than 1;; rationality problem in turn provoking the potential for opportu nistic behaviour from the outsourced service provider;; Thus the owner faces two fundamental problems 1 how to choose the appropriate degree of integration to obtain opti mal performance levels for maintenance services i;; Our research provides both insights and empirical findings on how to tackle these two fundamental problems in the maintenance of medical devices this is the main practical implications of our research;; because the multi period machine maintenance problemwith delegated control is a widespread problem Plambeck Zenios 2000 making our research highly generalizable;; The problem of the multi period machine maintenance problem with delegated con trol can be described by considering a critical piece of equipment which can be in one of two possible states functioning or non functioning;; AAMI s benchmarking solution Analysis of cost of service ratio and other metrics;; Special interest push indigent care solutions;;
