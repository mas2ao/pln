 Studies of the first cat egory mainly attribute the lack of support for TCT to measurement problems or the inherent difficulty of measuring core TCT constructs p;; Journal of Strategic Information Systems 20 2011 125 138 127former states that people are intendedly rational but their rationality is limited by their capacity to formulate and solve complex problems and to process information Williamson 1981 p;; The lock in problem results from opportunism Williamson 1985 ;; Measurement problems are the difficulties encountered in the evaluation of an element of the exchange Aubert et al;; The other five studies use measurement problems Aubert et al;; Some studies conceptualize uncertainty and measurement problems as two separate constructs;; For instance Poppo and Zenger 1998 use measurement problems as an agency theory construct and technological uncertainty as a TCT construct;; Based on the definitions and operationaliza tion provided in studies that used measurement problems the construct is related to task difficulty complexity or an inability to measure the performance inherent to the task;; Therefore we argue that although a measurement problem may give way to behavioral uncertainty or exacerbate a situation that includes behavioral uncertainty the construct differs conceptually from behavioral uncertainty;;
