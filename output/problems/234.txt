 We find that vertical integration of R D is still the solution of choice for pharmaceutical fiis;; Tapon s 1989 article used transaction costs analysis to hypothesize that new hybrid R D organizations linking privately owned firms and publicly owned institutions like university laboratories would become a solution of choice to the R D governance problem in the pharmaceutical industry;; Pisano 1990 studies the R D governance problem in the pharmaceutical industry while Pisano 1991 analyzes and Williamson has recently argued that vertical integration is the organization form not of first but of last resort to be adopted when all else fails;; Marketing New Product Starts Earning Income including the steps followed problems encountered measures taken to counter these problems and future evolution of the R D process;; Verify in each case that our theory predicts whether R D is done in house or through external R D joint ventures strategic alliances or equity stakes or whether a mix of both solutions is chosen;; The detailed sequence of the R D process and implications for the organization of R D Our findings indicate that the preferred solution is the vertically integrated in house R D laboratory;; When a compound essentially runs into problems with toxicity or efficacy in the clinical or safety studies the studies are terminated;; In addition because specialists from different backgrounds study the same problem anomalous observations are more easily recognized and investigated;; This opens the firm s R D laboratory to serendipitous discoveries which might be ignored in a laboratory where research programs are carried out by groups of scientists working on a problem one discipline at a time;; This is the reason that vertical integration into R D is the solution of choice for leading pharmaceutical firms;; However this does not disprove our finding that vertical integration is the normal solution of choice for pharmaceutical R D;;
