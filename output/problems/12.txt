 Barbara Praetorius is funded via the interdisciplinary research project TIPS transforma tion and innovation in power systems funded by the Germanpractice however some fundamental problems arise;; Aspects which need to be considered here include the problems and consequences of uncertainty and of leakage e;; Altogether the assessment of potentially efficient de signs for a system of tradable white certificates requires a careful analysis of the problematic issues and approaches to manage them in practice;;might ease measuring problems but at the same time reduce incentives for innovation approaches;; In other words it is not a make or buy problem but rather about realising energy savings with own customers versus energy savings with other customers;; The underlying problem is nottrivial;; Two crucial issues are to be solved both in theory and in practice;; But what exactly is the baseline and which reference technology should be accepted and which time frame applied How can energy savings be identified as supplemental or additional to a reference development What are the relevant boundaries for a project and how can leakage effects be minimised The related practical problems are multiple;; Standardised baselines and monitor ing procedures may alleviate the measurability problem;; This simultaneously eases the information problem and thus the transaction cost involved on the level of the certificate market;; Based on the theoretical framework of TCE we elaborated these issues as well as the related problems;; The definition problem is also Koomey J;;
