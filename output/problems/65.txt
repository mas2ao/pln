 An explanation is formulated for the emergence of the MC at the end of the nineteenth century as well as its current problems;; The issue of control in a governance structure is framed in terms of the problems associated with the specificity of investments;; The incompleteness of contracts causes problems in situations with specific investments because it prevents the division of the surplus from being specified ex ante;;3 presents two hold up problems in the relationship between the farmer and the processor;;1 Hold up Problem The incompleteness of contracts entails that not all eventualities can be described ex anle in a contract;; by the COUTL The incompleteness of contracts causes problems when the parties involved in the exchange make specific irreversible investments;; This is the inefficient hold up problem Klein et al;; A numerical example may illustrate the hold up problem;; The problem with this contract is that situations may arise for which the contract does not speciFy anything e;; Hold up is represented by the R branch whereas the hold up problem is represented by the N branch;; An expost problem like the hold up problem and issues of governance have no role in a complete contracting approach because there are no contingencies which are not covered by the contract;; The focus is on ex ante problems in the complete contracting approach whereas expost problems are at centre stage in an incomplete contracting setting;; This example is extreme in the sense that there is either the efficient investment decision or no investment at 56 Figure 1 Hold up Problem George W J;; Hart and Moore 1990 use the cooperative game theoretic solution concept Shapley value in order to derive that market governance is associated with the 5 50 split of the quasi surplus;;3 Hold up Problems in the Farmer Processor Relationship Two assets are involved in the evaluation of the MC as an efficient governance structure;; Each specific investment is associated with a hold up problem;; There are several ways of dealing with a hold up problem;; The governance structure MC resolves the first hold up problem but the second hold up problem remains unresolved;; The governance structure IOF eliminates the second hold up problem;; However the first hold up problem is not dealt with in a satisfactory way by an IOF;; MCVersusIOF This section extends the above example and provides a new way of graphically representing the choice of governance structure from an incomplete contracting perspective when there are two hold up problems;;2 We start with one hold up problem;; It depicts the relationship between the choice of governance structure and the hold up problem regarding farm investments for various levels of asset specificity b;; An ex anle competitive situation is moved into an ex post bilateral monopoly problem;; This is the hold up problem;; Marketing Cc operatives An Incomplete Contracting Perspective 61 Figure 4 TWO Hold up Problems and Efficient Governance Figure 4 depicts a situation where specific investments are considered at both stages of production;; Hmdrikse and Gees I Veerman stage of production becomes relatively more problematic;; An MC is not good at dealing with this hold up problem because it is geared towards advocating and protecting the interests of farmers;;708 which states that Firm 1 control will be desirable when firm 1 s ex anle investmen t is much more important than firm 2 s so that firm 2 s underinvestment under firm 1 control is relatively unimportant and when overinvestment by firm 1 under firm 1 control is a less severe problem than underinvestment by firm 1 ;; An MC has to address two hold up problems;; The countervailing power feature of an MC resolves this problem;; This second problem is not important when the investments of an MC are not specific which is the case in markets with homogeneous products;; It is claimed that an increase in the extent Our claims regarding the level of asset specificity of the investments at the processing stage of production are formulated relative to the hold up problem regarding farm investments;; Most solutions which are nowadays considered within the MC American Crystal Sugar is an example of an IOF which was converted to an MC;; The change at American Crystal Sugar does not undermine our theory because it provides an example of increasing importance of the first hold up problem without making any references to the final product market;; If the first hold up problem becomes more important and the second does not then our theory predicts that switches from an IOF LO an MC are to be expected;; It is claimed that the perishability of crops is nowadays not as much a problem anymore due to technological developments;; This observation strengthens our claim because it suggests that the first hold rip problem has diminished in importance compared to the second hold up problem;; However this does not solve the second hold up problem;; the value of S in order to solve two hold up problems;; An additional degree of freedom has to be created in order to be able to deal with both problems;;
