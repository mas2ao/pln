 Most of the empirical models reviewed here suffer from three methodological problems;; The most common problems in these models are self selection bias e;; Most have limitations related to the data used or multiple types of methodological problems enumerated above;; Hospital consolidation may achieve efficiencies beyond service coordination operation at higher occupancy rates can be achieved by reducing the peak load problem whereby each pre merger hospital must retain enough staff to handle periods of high demand;; Instead these decisions were primarily an artifact of the governmental uniform pricing system for skilled nursing care which disadvantaged market contracting solutions and encouraged vertical integration by preventing hospi tals and nursing homes from developing flexible pricing rules to align incentives of buyers and sellers;; Other rationales are related to managerialism whereby managerial discretion and control allow pursuit of goals that are not profit maximizing for the firm an especially significant potential problem in the non profit sector according to Fama Jensen 19 ;; The bridge between policy analysis demands and economic theory is still missing in the health services research literature al though this problem extends beyond the study of hospitals;; Depending on the type of spec ification error the econometric model may have biased parameter estimates incorrect signs on parameters higher standard errors or other problems;;
