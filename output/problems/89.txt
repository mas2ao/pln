 While the moral Journal of Operations Management to their captive centers off shore which is not considered as out hazard problem in a principal agent setting has been addressed extensively in the extant literature this has largely dealt withmanagerialmonitoring of employers in sourcing ;; In cross border BPO contracts however the monitoring problem is inter firm and the recent technological advances that have enabled the monitoring of supplier s agents in real time by the buyer are a relatively new phenomenon;; s CentrEE Solution Suite s Quality Monitoring Module allows for managers to observe and asses the quality of agents interactionwith customers whileVoice Print International Inc;; An important problem that we choose to investigate in this paper is the impact of monitoring across the boundaries of the firm in real time even as the production of services takes place across the globe;; The extant literature in economics has analyzed the problem of governance mechanisms associated with a make versus buy decision and what governance mechanism would optimally define a supply contract;; These papers either exogenously fixed the buyer supplier contract or studied settings in which non cooperative solution is first best;; For instance Dell Computers uses a third party service provider to monitor the working of their call centers and query resolution operations in several countries;; Allsec Tech s agents resolve supply chain coordination problems by tracking invoice clearance payment and accounts receivables and payables and through expert interven tion where it is called for;; While price coordinates economic activity managerial monitoring mechanisms a feature of hierarchy are employed to mitigate moral hazard problems that appear in the execution of the contract;; This is a canonical outsourcing model with moral hazard problems confounding the make or buy choice leaving the buyer a service firm facing a trade off between attractive labor arbitrage and misaligned incentives between buyer and seller;; There are two important observations that we make in this context the above functional forms have been used widely in extant research as they are considered to be an ideal abstraction of the problem domain more importantly we estimated these through econometric techniques from the data that we gathered on off shore outsourcing practices across several countries and firms;; The total cost of correction to the provider is the original production cost plus the cost of correcting the error and ensuring an error free output of the process which effectively equals the cost of delivering the full quality solution;; 11 This price does not guarantee the optimal quality the contract is prone to moral hazard problems;;14 This sets up the classic moral hazard problem;; When faced with this problem several firms in our survey chose an option that is possible largely because of the nature of the work outsourced work that involves no transformation of physical goods but only the transformation of informa tion results allows fine grained real time monitoring of work from a remote location Aron and Singh 2005 ;; This leads us to two important optimization problems faced by the buyer;; To solve the buyer s problem of determining the optimal precision level given by 1 u we must investigate the provider s incentives;; The provider s decision problem The provider faces the problem of making the choice of optimal quality;; We are now ready to solve the buyer s problem of choice of optimal level of precision;; It thus becomes clear that the solution will involve solving the resulting game between the buyer and provider;; Dynamics of the buyer service provider game Wemodel the decision problems of the buyer and the service provider as a game;; The buyer in turn is aware of the provider s incentives and will pick the u that maximizes his total expected profits given by B V u M Vq u M u c0 The above reaction function of the Buyer s profit surplus indicates the nature of the solution techni que the buyer will solve the three stage game starting with the final stage through Backward Induction to arrive at a Subgame Perfect Equilibrium solution;;ui qi 1 This observation leads us to the provider s optimiza tion problem;; Provider s optimization problem When faced with a value of u the provider has three choices 1 pick a level of quality q u q q 2 pick a level of quality q q u q 1 or 3 pick a R;; It can be seen from Propositions 3 5 that this game has a solution where the buyer and the provider s strategies given respectively by u q are best responses of each other;; The precision quality schedule of u q below represents the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium solution to the game;; 19 Scaling the deviation of the signal from a true value by the true value s magnitude is a commonly used econometric technique for problems in this domain;; Monitoring greatly expands the scope of off shore outsourcing For a variety of processes off shore outsourcing was hitherto not possible either because of acute moral hazard problems or because the traditional division of in house and outsourced options were not rich enough to span all the contingencies that could arise from outsourcing complex processes;; Option contracts and renegotiation a solution to the hold up problem;;
